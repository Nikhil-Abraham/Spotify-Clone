# Spotify-Clone
### Created spotify Front-End clone of spotify.com, Used React Context API to store user data, User is first authenticated by spotify, then data is transfered and sent to the application through the spotify API. Then all user data like profile picture, playlists, discover-weekly playlist etc. is displayed using various React Components.
